# purrgatory-translation-progress-tracker

This is a small web project I made to help keep track of progress for volunteer translators for purrgatory!

It can tell you the word count of your translation and how many cells you've translated.

You can access it [here!](https://nyutie.github.io/purrgatory-translation-progress-tracker/)

## Currently there is an issue that prevents it from working, I'm working to fix it asap!!
